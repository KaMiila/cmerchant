	Tavern lets you buy a wench for the night who can also give you information on pirates, traders or other special options (contract killings)  Taverns are also where you can also buy mercenaries/bodyguards and find new or more crew memebers.
	Brokerage office is for traders only, gives you set prices and routes for goods, less risky trade through a broker but not as good returns.
Travel routes show number of days before you depart.
Ships log shows how many days worth of supplies you have for your crew.  They also keep a running database on all crew memebers, their loyalty to you, ships statistics, including guns, seaworthyness, and cargo (where you purchased it and for what price).  Logs will also show you what contracts you are currently on.
Expanded shipping ports, some will be hostile to you, others will not.  Some will accept only certain goods others will not.  See the broker for more details.
